## 📌 Title: Data is a Funny Thing  

---

### 🧠 Overview  

Data is a funny thing.  

I felt overstimulated today while going through job listings — trying to see how my learning could fit into each one. The more I read, the more I felt overwhelmed and inadequate. Like no matter how much I studied, there would always be something I lacked.  

So I went for a walk. It was already dark. I did some grounding exercises to pause my thoughts for a moment — name three things I could see, two I could hear, and one I could feel. Slowly, the noise quieted down. The dim streetlights, the sound of my slippers on the pavement, and the cool air brushing against my skin brought me back to the present.  

And then the thought hit me — a light bulb moment.  

What if, after all this studying, the “data” ends up showing that this path isn’t for me? What if I walk this entire road only to realize that this wasn’t where I was meant to go?  

But then I realized… that’s exactly what data science is about. Feeling lost, messy, uncertain — that’s just the raw data. My job isn’t to panic about the mess. It’s to clean it, organize it, and make sense of it. Only then can I analyze it properly and see what story it’s trying to tell.  

And maybe the most ironic part?  
The same exact data that was making me anxious… was also the same data that gave *structure* to my messy thoughts.  

If someday I feel like I don’t belong in this field, I can treat it like analysis:  
- What findings led me there?  
- What KPIs did I measure?  
- Based on the data, what can I improve on to fit better into this role?  

If the results still don’t align after I iterate, I go back again. Clean, analyze, adjust, repeat — until the model starts to make sense.  

Analysts probably aren’t expected to get the right answer the first time. And maybe that’s the point. It’s the repetition, the refining, the willingness to go through the pipeline again and again that builds real understanding.  

I guess that’s where I am now — somewhere between raw and refined data.  
Still cleaning, still learning, still iterating.
