## 🧠 Overview  
Day 32 concludes the foundational phase of the STR Analytics pipeline.  
The goal was to produce a **clean, validated, and analysis-ready dataset** by merging raw listings and calendar data into a single unified table for future KPI and trend analyses.  

Through this process, the entire SQL → Python → Power BI workflow was tested end-to-end, ensuring that each stage produced consistent and reliable outputs.

## 🔁 Pipeline Summary  
| Stage | Tool | Output | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| Block 1 | SQL | `clean_final` table | Merged listings and calendar tables, standardized prices and dates |
| Block 2 | Python | `clean_final_validated.csv` | Validated shape, data types, and null values |
| Block 3 | Power BI | STR Pipeline Summary dashboard | Visualized key KPIs and verified dataset integrity |
| Block 4 | GitHub | Learning Log & Reflection | Documented insights and closed the Data Foundation phase |

## 📚 Key Learnings  
- **Schema Consistency:** Using `listing_id` as the central join key simplifies merges and future relational modeling.  
- **Data Hygiene:** Even small text inconsistencies (like `" t"` vs `"t"`) can cause major visual misreads in Power BI — trimming and normalizing early prevents this.  
- **Pipeline Modularity:** Separating `raw`, `interim`, and `processed` folders mirrors a professional ETL workflow and improves reproducibility.  
- **Power BI Validation:** The availability breakdown and KPI checks confirmed that the merge logic from SQL matched perfectly with Python validation results.  
- **Visual Design:** Applying the *blakusnaku orange* palette and standardized footer gives every dashboard a cohesive brand identity and clear metadata trail.

## 💬 Reflections  
Today felt like a major transition point — from building the foundation to preparing for full STR analysis.  
Everything now connects seamlessly: SQL handles structure, Python handles quality control, and Power BI handles insight delivery.  

This setup means future STR analyses (pricing trends, occupancy modeling, host performance) will plug directly into a ready dataset without rework.  
It’s a tangible sign that the **100 Days of Data framework** has matured into a fully functioning analytics ecosystem.
