# üß† Block 4 ‚Äî Learning Log  
**Day 23 | October 21, 2025**  
**Theme:** Conditional Logic Across the Pipeline  
**Repository:** [blakusnaku-100-days-of-data](https://github.com/blakusnaku-100-days-of-data)  
**Dataset:** superstore_with_category.csv  
**Phase:** SQL Fundamentals ‚Üí Python Foundations ‚Üí Power BI Integration

## üîπ Overview
Today‚Äôs session focused on mastering **conditional logic** across all three tools in the analytics pipeline ‚Äî from `CASE` statements in SQL, to `np.where()` in Python, and logical category filtering in Power BI.  
The core objective was to ensure consistency of logic flow and visual interpretation across different tools.

## üî∏ Pipeline Summary

| Block | Tool | Focus | Output |
|:--:|:--|:--|:--|
| 1 | SQL | Used `CASE WHEN` to categorize sales by value | Classified data as High / Medium / Low |
| 2 | Python | Replicated logic using `np.where()` | Exported `superstore_with_category.csv` |
| 3 | Power BI | Added slicer and visuals for category filtering | ‚ÄúSales Category Breakdown‚Äù dashboard |
| 4 | GitHub | Reflection + Documentation | `learning_log.md`, `README.md`, and repo updates |

## üî∏ Key Learnings

1. **Conditional Logic Parity:**  
   Translating logic between SQL (`CASE`) and Python (`np.where()`) deepens understanding of vectorized thinking and ensures data classification stays consistent across platforms.

2. **Dimension Tables for Sorting:**  
   Learned how to implement a **Sort Table (DATATABLE)** and use `RELATED()` to properly order categorical slicers ‚Äî a professional-level Power BI modeling technique.

3. **Clean Relationship Design:**  
   The one-to-many structure between the lookup (`SalesCategoryOrder`) and fact (`superstore_with_category`) table ensures model scalability and clean filtering logic.

4. **Power BI Visual Continuity:**  
   The orange gradient theme and consistent slicer logic reinforce a clear visual identity across dashboards, strengthening portfolio cohesion.

## üí¨ Reflections
This block tied together a full logic pipeline from data query to visualization ‚Äî proof that structured conditional logic can maintain accuracy even across different tools.  
The slicer design, combined with the proper sort table relationship, marks an important step toward professional-grade dashboard modeling.  

Future iterations will focus on improving **KPI presentation** and **slicer interactivity** using conditional formatting, dynamic colors, and iconography for a more polished experience.
