# 📊 100 Days of Data: SQL → Python → Power BI

**by blakusnaku (JP Malit)**

---

## 🧩 Overview  
This is my **100-day learning journey** where I connect **data querying, transformation, and visualization** across SQL, Python, and Power BI. Each day is structured into four blocks:  
1. Data extraction or joining (SQL / SQLite)  
2. Data transformation & cleaning (Python / pandas)  
3. Dashboard or visuals (Power BI)  
4. Reflection & learning log (Markdown)  

Projects range from dummy datasets and joins to real datasets (like Superstore) — all curated to build my analytical fluency and portfolio.

*(Each link goes to that day’s folder, which contains its own README, scripts, data, dashboard, and notes.)*

## ⛓️ Study Dashboard Hub  
All your day projects feed into a **central Study Dashboard** — a meta view of your progress and metrics.

## 📌 Future Plans  
- Automate dataset ingestion pipelines  
- Add interactive features to dashboards (filters, slicers)  
- Build weekly or monthly summary dashboards  
- Share versioned snapshots of dashboards (v1.0, v2.0)
