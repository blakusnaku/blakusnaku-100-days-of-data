## ðŸ§­ Overview
Day 22 focused on **multi-table modeling** using the custom **Orders**, **Shipping Cost**, and **Returns** datasets. The goal was to simulate a real relational data pipeline â€” from SQL creation to Python merging and Power BI relationship modeling â€” showcasing how clean joins enable deeper business insights.

## ðŸ”— Pipeline Summary

| Block | Tool | Focus | Output |
|:------|:-----|:-------|:--------|
| **Block 1** | SQL | Created schemas and practiced JOINs | `orders`, `shipping_cost`, and `returns` tables generated |
| **Block 2** | Python | Merged three tables and validated relationships | `merged_orders.csv` exported for Power BI |
| **Block 3** | Power BI | Built data model and interactive visuals | Multi-table dashboard with return-rate and cost analysis |
| **Block 4** | GitHub | Documented workflow and insights | `learning_log.md` and updated `README.md` |

## ðŸ§  Key Learnings
- Multi-table setups mirror real database design and encourage thinking in relationships, not flat files.  
- Matching **keys and data types** across all sources prevents join errors and missing data.  
- Power BIâ€™s **relationship view** makes SQL logic visual and intuitive.  
- Calculating **Return Rate = [Returned Orders] / COUNTROWS(Orders)** introduced practical DAX use.  
- Maintaining numeric fields free of formatting symbols ensures smoother merges.

## ðŸ’­ Reflections
Day 22 connected the dots between your technical phases â€” SQL logic, Python data prep, and Power BI modeling â€” into one end-to-end system. Seeing the data link seamlessly across tools reinforced why structured design and data integrity matter for scalable analytics.
